    "There are a number of interesting domains to research regarding this challenge. Some play a direct role whereas others are less visible but potentially influential. Our direct influences are directly connected to a specific animal. Examples are an animal's type, colour, breed, age and so on. These factors could cause an animal to be picked before others in the same shelter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indirect influences are locational factors connected to an animal shelter. People might be less likely go visit a shelter when it's raining. They could also be more likely to get a dog when they see lots of people walking their dog. Prosperity is also interesting considering pets can be expensive meaning richer neighbourhoods might see more adoptions than poorer ones.\n",

    "Having walked to a shelter the general impression I got is that they weren't very interested in predicting how long an animal would stay there. This is mostly explained because regardless of how long it takes the animal wouldn't get euthanised at this shelter. They also had concerns with human factors causing coincidence to play too big of a role. If the prediction is too inaccurate it won't be useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Governments might be more interested. Using the adoption patterns, we could later estimate how busy a shelter will be at a certain moment of time based on its current occupation. These insights can be used to manage the population better and invest money into adoption campaigns in certain months."
