    "# Shelter Animals - Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this challenge is to predict the amount of time it will take for a cat or dog to get adopted. By combining this information with the average intake of animals, shelters can estimate their future occupation. After having interviewed a shelter manager, I noticed there was some misinformation going around regarding adoption speeds of certain animals. One of the examples given were that black cats got adopted slower. While this appears true, the real reason animals contain more black animals is because the black coats of cats and dogs is a dominant trait. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the project is successful the final model can be deployed as an app. Those with permission will be able to quickly check the estimated adoption rates of their animals."

    "# 1. Domain Understanding  <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter1\"></a>\n",
    "Domain Understanding is the amount of knowledge you have of a specific, specialized discipline, profession or field. Having proper Domain Understanding helps in all steps of an AI Project. In this step we will address the context understanding, the goal of the project and a potential impact assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context Understanding  \n",
    "In context understanding we research the concerning organisation or discipline, the concerning stakeholders, requirements and KPI's. The research mostly consists out of library research. A full list of sources can be found under [Chapter 4](#chapter4).\n",
    "\n",
    "I also gained information by interviewing an expert in the field. Having worked at an animal shelter in the past, I was able to contact them. This helped to confirm conclusions I had already read about and gave me some insights in how the Netherlands differentiated from America. The full (Dutch) transcription is included in the file 'Animal Shelter Interview'.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Adoption Rate Factors\n",
    "Previous research indicates that prospective adopters care about factors such as an animal’s appearance, friendliness, health, age and breed type. There is also evidence that the colour of an animal’s fur impacts adoption likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "People prefer adopting kittens over cats more than they do adopting puppies over dogs. While 95 percent of puppies get adopted compared to 75 percent of young dogs and 68 percent of senior dogs, the rates drop much faster for cats. About 82 percent of kittens get adopted, but as they get older the likelihood drops, and once they pass around 18 months old, only 60 percent of cats get adopted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coat colour also matters. Black cats don’t have trouble getting adopted but tend to be more present in shelters because the black coat is a dominant trait. Black and white cats get adopted at lower rates than any other colour, whereas grey cats and orange tabbies get adopted at the highest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In dogs the colour is less of a factor, while race plays a much larger role. Pit bull type dogs stay in shelters two to three times longer than the average dog. Size plays a much larger roles when it comes to adopting dogs than adoption cats. This could be because the size variation within cats is much smaller than among dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stray Animals and Neutering\n",
    "\n",
    "The European Union estimates that there are about one hundred million abandoned companion animals in Europe. The stray population can be reduced in the long-term using the Catch-Neuter-Vaccinate-Return method. Dogs and cats are caught, neutered and vaccinated, and as soon as they are recovered from surgery, they are released back to their previous territory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eighteen out of thirty-one surveyed countries also had some form of subsidized neutering scheme. However, most schemes were only available at specific locations. In most instances it was animal welfare organisations that provided this service to owners. \n",
    "\n",
    "In America over thirty states have “holding period” laws, which provide a minimum required period that an animal must be kept before it is sold, adopted out or euthanized. Typically, the holding period runs from five to seven days. However, it can be as short as 48 to 72 hours in some cases. The catching methods tend to be a lot less humane and traumatizing for the animals. While the neutering method is practised in the US it is a lot less common.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the United States 80% of the pet dogs and 82% of pet cats are spayed or neutered. However, it’s important to remember that pet cats only represent a part of the entire US population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Euthanasia Of Animals\n",
    "Euthanasia of animals differs greatly per country. In America a lot of stray animals are put to sleep while in Europe it is varies from country to country. Germany and Italy only euthanise if the animals are in poor health. Many countries kill an animal when it is not picked up after a customary holding period, whereas two countries kill them immediately. The Netherlands does not specify this in the law, but most shelters have a no-kill policy.\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "4176a3f3",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Note the wording here is important. The Animal Welfare of the European Union declared the term euthanising only applies if it would be better for an animal to be dead than to continue suffering. If the animal is killed for the owner’s convenience, for food or because laboratory experiments have finished it is considered killing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason animals are euthanized in shelters is due to overcrowding caused by an overpopulation of unwanted and abandoned animals. A shelter may also euthanize animals deemed “unadoptable”. In America animal shelters have to confirm with state laws, such as a waiting period and written notice to registered owners. If the owner is unknown there needs to be a public notice so owners have the chance of claiming their pet. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Occupancy\n",
    "Animal shelters tend to be the busiest during the summer. Some people that go on holiday abandon or surrender their pets, while less people adopt. As a result, the occupancy tends to be at its peak. Gates are left open while gardening or while people enjoy the weather, which causes more animals to escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kitten season for stray cats typically starts in the spring and extends into the summer. When people see a new-born litter, they get scared and take them to the shelter if they don’t immediately see their mother.\n",
    "\n",
    "In America July 5th is one of the busiest days in connection to the fireworks on July 4th. Animals that get scared run away and often end up miles from their homes. New Year’s Day is nearly as bad. This is worsened by people who regret buying a pet as a Christmas gift and surrender it shortly after.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Farm Cats\n",
    "Some cats are more independent than others and don’t do well in a typical family home. At Battersea, these cats are referred to as ‘farm’, ‘outlet’ or ‘working’ cats and are rehomed to outlets where they can live in a way that best suits them. Farms, garden centres, stables and rural homes with outbuildings are just some of the places we’ve already rehomed farm cats to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Puppy mills\n",
    "Animals from puppy mills are housed in shockingly poor conditions with improper medical care. They are often very sick and end up behaviourally troubled as a result. The mothers of these puppies are kept in cages to be bred over and over for years, without human companionship and with little hope of ever joining a family. After they're no longer profitable, breeding dogs are often discarded; either by killed, abandoned or sold at auction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the US, roughly 90 percent of puppies in pet stores come from puppy mills. Many retailers who buy animals from such facilities take the wholesaler’s word that the animals are happy and healthy without seeing for themselves.\n"

    "1. [Shelter Animal Outcomes](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/data?select=train.csv.gz)\n",
    "2. [Austin Animal Center Shelter Outcomes](https://www.kaggle.com/aaronschlegel/austin-animal-center-shelter-outcomes-and)\n",
    "3. [Animal Shelter Analytics](https://www.kaggle.com/jackdaoud/animal-shelter-analytics?select=Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets mostly contain the same features. The Austin Animal Center Shelter Outcomes dataset contains the date of birth which you can calculate in the other datasets. The first two datasets don't include the moment of intake, meaning it is not possible to figure out how long animals stay at the shelter. It would only be an option if we wanted to predict if the animal did or did not get adopted. The third is more interesting for our use case. Important to note is that the data is split over an intake and outcome set.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm also interested if these is a correlation between the number of pets in the shelter and the adoption rate. It should also be possible to find this out using the available data. \n",
    "\n",
    "I later found that all of the Austin Animal Shelter data is publicly available at [austintexas](https://data.austintexas.gov/browse?City-of-Austin_Department-=Animal+Services&sortBy=most_accessed). I made use of the [intakes](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Intakes/wter-evkm) and [outcomes](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Outcomes/9t4d-g238) and combined them into a dataset by linking animal ID and nearby dates. This includes all data the other datasets do and is constantly being updated, meaning the values are up to date. This is the data we'll mainly be using.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Location Data <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter5.1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Austin is located in Texas. Houston, San Antonio and Dallas are relatively nearby. There might be local factors that encourage people to adopt an animal such as the weather. Although I couldn't find much relevant information on [Texas's website](https://data.texas.gov/) I did find an external [website](https://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/austin/texas/united-states/ustx2742) that keeps the climate data of each city in the US. This data would have to be scraped before it can be used. It will be important to keep a distinction between weather and time of the year. Correlation won't necessarily mean causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential correlation would be adoption speed with the amount of pets in the area. The more pets there are, the more people come into contact with them. This could lead to people wanting a pet of their own. Sadly, I was not able to find any data to confirm or deny this.  "

    "# 6. Analytic Approach <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter6\"></a>\n",
    "The result of this step is to define the target variable of the prediction, the nature of the target variable and to find out which of the features from the data are good indicators for chosen target variable. Ultimately the result of this step is also the deliverable of phase 1; namely a project proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1 Target Variable <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter6.1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable is the amount of time is takes for a cat or dog in a shelter to get adopted. This is not an existing value in our initial dataset but a value we have to calculate by combining two datasets. It can be calculated by subtracting the intake date from the outcome date. The resulting value will be the amount of time the animal has stayed in the shelter. \n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable could take the form of an exact timestamp, a number of days or a days bucket. The latter refers to a separation of target variables into various time periods. For example, does it take 0-7 days, 7-14 days, 14-30 days or 30+ days. The exact timestamp seems counterintuitive. I'd much rather see a number of days as output because that would be a lot more clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefor the form will either be a number of days or a period of time for a cat or dog to be adopted. My preference goes out to the period of time, but we might give both a try.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2 Nature of Target Variable <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter6.2\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The value we're trying to predict is a supervised one. If we are to take the number of days as target variable this makes the nature of our target variable regression. However, if we are to use the bucketed period of time we'll be predicting which time period an animal falls under. In that case the nature instead is classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion I want to try two types of target variables to see the difference in performance. I want to try a simple regression and a more in depth classification variable. But in short my preference and priority goes out to classification.\n",

    "## 6.3 Indicators <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter6.3\"></a>\n",
    "These are conclusions we were able to draw from the Exploratory Data Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dogs get adopted faster than cats.\n",
    "- Pit bulls are adopted slower compared to other breeds.\n",
    "- Siamese cats might be adopted faster.\n",
    "- Gender does not seem to influence adoption speed.\n",
    "- Tricolored and Tan animals are likely to be adopted relatively fast. Brown, Black and White animals are adopted at equal speed while torties take a little bit longer.\n",
    "- Animals born in 2014 to 2018 were adopted faster. \n",
    "- Animals with unknown name were adopted faster. This could be because they hadn't been named yet.\n",
    "- Because most animals are castrated this doesn't seem to influence adoption speed by much. \n",
    "- Normal intakes were adopted a lot faster than injured, sick or nursing animals.\n",
    "- Public assists take longer to get adopted than strays and owner surrenders.\n",
    "- Euthanasia requests seem to get adopted a lot slower, but the sample size is very small.\n",
    "- Young animals are adopted faster. This is mostly visible in animals under 1 year, but still the case for animals under 3 years.\n",
    "- There are more adoptions on the weekend. The months January, July and December also seem to be favoured.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.4 Potential ML Models <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter6.4\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several machine learning models I'm interested in trying out and comparing to one another. The main focus will be on classification, but I might also try some regression. As mentioned earlier in this document I split my target variable into buckets in order to perform classification on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I plan to compare simple classification (Decision Tree / KNN) with Logistic Regression then dive deeper. We'll be comparing different models because some might perform better for our use case than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification\n",
    "- Decision Tree\n",
    "- K Nearest Neighbour\n",
    "- Random Forest\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine Classification\n",
    "- Neural Network (in leftover time)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression\n",
    "- Linear Regression\n",
    "- Lasso\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.5 Reliability <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter6.5\"></a>\n",
    "I'm going to try out different regression models to see how they compare. If the results differ greatly, I'll try to find out the reason behind this. It could mean that one model is better suited or that something went wrong in one of the attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.6 Domain Knowledge Verification <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter6.6\"></a>\n",
    "The dataset will be split into a testing, training and validation set to evaluate the performance of the model. Outside of this I will attempt to contact the shelter again to see which data they have available and are willing to share. Evaluating the model on data of an entirely different shelter would be very interesting. They could also comment on any correlations that I find and whether they find them believable or whether something else might be going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.7 Acceptable Evaluation Results <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter6.7\"></a>\n",
    "Acceptable evaluation results are highly dependent on the nature of a project. In the case of a self driving car or medical AI we want to aim for a very high accuracy, whereas a prediction on the winner of a sports match could have a much lower one. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of the project is to gain some insights into how long it takes for an animal to get adopted. Because of this the acceptable accuracy is a lot lower. Initially my aim was 70%. After doing a little more research I found that a lot of similar projects on Kaggle.com ended around the 40-45% accuracy mark. Therefor anything above this would be a success in my eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.8 Deployment Plan <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter6.8\"></a>\n",
    "Depending on the success of the project the plan is to deploy the model as a flask endpoint by pickling it. Any scaling and encoding will be done in the backend. The front end will either be a simple flask app or a React app."
